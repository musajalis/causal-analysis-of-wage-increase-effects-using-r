# Causal Analysis of Wage Increase Effects Using R
This project analyzed the causal effects of wage changes on employment and labor hours using the Card & Krueger (1994) dataset. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and subsetted in R using packages such as dplyr, tidyr, magrittr, and readstata13 to enable year- and state-specific analyses. Descriptive statistics were calculated for full-time equivalent hours (fte) and employment (empft), highlighting differences between states before and after the wage increase. These insights provided a clear overview of labor market trends and variations across states and time.

To assess the impact of the policy change, difference-in-differences (DiD) regression models were implemented in R, incorporating interaction terms (year * state) to isolate the causal effect of the wage increase on both fte and employment. The regression analysis revealed nuanced effects of wage increases on labor outcomes. This project showcases expertise in R programming, linear modeling, statistical analysis, and causal inference methodology.
