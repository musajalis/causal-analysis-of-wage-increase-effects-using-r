# Causal Analysis of Wage Increase Effects
This project analyzed the causal effects of wage changes on employment and labor hours using the Card & Krueger (1994) dataset. Descriptive statistics were calculated for full-time equivalent hours (fte) and employment (empft), highlighting differences between states before and after the wage increase. These insights provided a clear overview of labor market trends and variations across states and time.

To assess the impact of the policy change, difference-in-differences (DiD) regression models were implemented, incorporating interaction terms (year * state) to isolate the causal effect of the wage increase on both fte and employment. The regression analysis revealed nuanced effects of wage increases on labor outcomes. This project showcases linear modeling, statistical analysis, and causal inference methodology. The analysis was conducted in R.
